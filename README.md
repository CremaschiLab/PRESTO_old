# PRESTO

PRESTO (Predictive REcommendations of Surrogate models to approximate and Optimize) can be run using the executable file labeled PRESTO.

In the app, data can be uploaded using the "Submit" button. 
For a dataset, users can calculate the tool attributes, and get recommendations for either approximation 
or surrogate-based optimization. 

Data should be uploaded in an excel file. 
There is a blank template file with instructions on how to input data as "tool_data_blank.xlsx" if you would like to test out the tool on your own data. 
There is also a file with some sample data already filled in ("tool_data_test.xlsx")
